## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on a project, keeping a history of all changes made.

## Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Git enables you to track changes and revert to previous states of your project.
- **Collaboration**: Collaborate seamlessly with others by sharing and merging code changes.
- **Backup**: Store your project on remote servers like GitHub for backup and collaboration.
- **Branching**: Create isolated development branches for features or bug fixes.
- **Community**: Join a vast community of developers who use Git for open-source projects.

## Key Terminology

### Repository (Repo)

A Git repository is a folder that contains all the files and the history of your project.

### Working Directory

The working directory is where you create, edit, and organize your project's files.

### Staging Area (Index)

The staging area is where you prepare changes for committing.

### Local Repository

The local repository stores all the project's history on your computer.

## Git Basics

### Initializing a Repository

To create a new Git repository, run:
git init
This initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

Adding Files (Staging)
git add <file(s)>
Staging prepares changes to be included in the next commit

Committing Changes
Commit changes with:
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Commits save your changes to the Git history.

Pushing and Pulling
Push your changes to a remote repository:
git push origin <branch>

Pull changes from a remote repository:
git pull origin <branch>

Branching
Creating a Branch
Create a new branch with:
git branch <branch-name>

Switching Between Branches
Switch to a different branch:
git checkout <branch-name>

Merging Branches
Merge changes from one branch into another:
git merge <branch-name>

Resolving Conflicts
Conflicts occur when Git can't automatically merge changes. Resolve conflicts by editing the affected files and then committing the changes.


Stashing Changes
Stash Commands
Stash your changes for later use:
git stash

List stashes:
git stash list
Apply a stash:
git stash apply <stash-name>


Reset and Revert
Resetting Commits
Undo commits with:
git reset <commit>

Reverting Commits
Revert commits with:
git revert <commit>


Tags
Creating Tags
Create a lightweight tag:
git tag <tag-name>

Viewing Tags
View all tags:
git tag

GitHub Integration
Cloning a Repository
Clone a repository from GitHub:
git clone <repository-url>

Pushing Changes to GitHub
Push your local changes to GitHub:
git push origin <branch>

Pulling Changes from GitHub
Pull changes from GitHub:
git pull origin <branch>
